# Hiya FIXD!

So I made this app to see if I could attempt to solve the basic
requirements of the coding challenge and to fix a problem I've
been having personally.

I wanted a way for people to see and easily hear the most recent music
I've been listening to on Spotify without logging into their desktop
Spotify apps and looking on that sidebar thing to the right.

Hence, Last.fm scrobbles to Spotify search to make a tracklist embed
using good ol' iframes that can be put on any website.

Too bad the rate limit gets hit pretty fast and the app stops to function the
way it should but that's a problem for another day.

Can't wait to explain this to y'all if you have any questions.

## Getting it up and running

So main requirements:

- nodejs
- gulp 4.0
- bower

Instructions:

1. run `npm install`
2. run `bower install`
3. run `gulp`

And voila the app should be up and running at `localhost:300`.

If you run into any issues installing nodejs, gulp 4.0 or bower just let me know!

Looking forward to speaking to y'all!
